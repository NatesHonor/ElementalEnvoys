# Elemental Envoys Plugin

The **Elemental Envoys** plugin adds an exciting gameplay element to your Minecraft server, allowing players to summon special events known as "envoys" in designated areas.

## Features

- Players can use the `/envoy wand` command to receive a wand that helps them define the area where they want envoys to spawn.
- Once the desired area is selected, players can use the `/envoy create <name>` command to create an envoy area with a specified name.
- Envoys will then periodically spawn at the created envoy area, bringing unique challenges and rewards for players who participate.
- Customize the frequency, difficulty, and rewards of envoys through configurable settings.
